# Outram

## About
This repository holds the official implementation of the paper: "Outram: One-shot Global Localization via Triangulated Scene Graph and Global Outlier Pruning" where we leverage single LiDAR measurements (which is different from accumulative methods e.g., mcl-based methods) for global localization (or pose initialization).
